Simple Django project for creating companies and doing CRUD operations on them(Hiring new employees,fire employees,edit employees)

Actually this project was suppose to be a test for a company, but I was really motivated doing it and developed many new skills through it!

Just simply GIT clone the Git Repository to IDE of your taste or you can download the git repository.
Dont forget that you must migrate by typing (python manage.py migrate) on your terminal to apply the DataBase and work properly!
